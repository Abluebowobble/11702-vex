About Us

We are Team 11702, a dedicated VEX Robotics team built on unity, excellence, and innovation.
Our members design, build, and program competitive robots that take on new engineering challenges every season. But beyond the field, we are a team that values creativity, collaboration, and the drive to push boundaries.

From late-night build sessions to high-stakes competitions, we work together to solve problems, learn new skills, and grow as leaders. Our mission is simple: to engineer with passion, compete with pride, and inspire the next generation of innovators.
