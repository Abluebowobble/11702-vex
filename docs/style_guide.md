## 3. Typography

* **Headlines / Hero:**

  * Bold Sans Serif, geometric (e.g., *Oswald*, *Bebas Neue*).
  * Huge, uppercase, stretched, often stacked or vertical.
  * Spontaneous letter arrangements (e.g., rotated, scattered, vertical slogans).
* **Subheaders:**

  * Clean sans serif, medium weight.
  * Often in contrast color (red on white, black on red).
* **Body Copy:**

  * Simple sans serif (e.g., *Roboto*, *Inter*).
  * Keep it short, minimal text per section.

Text Treatments:

* Playful distortions of alignment (not strictly centered or flush left/right).
* Bold slogans used decoratively, not just informationally.

  * Mixed sizes, collage‑like grid.
  * Asymmetry allowed → spontaneous placement.
* **Team Cards:**

  * Grid layout but with bold color blocks and spontaneous accents.
* **Section Breaks:**

  * Diagonal or irregular dividers, not just flat lines.

## 5. Imagery

* **Style:** High energy, action shots, expressive candid photos.
* **Composition:** Not overly staged; embrace motion blur, angles, and rawness.
* **Integration:** Images bleed into text, cropped in unexpected ways.

## 6. Components

* **Buttons:**

  * Big, rectangular, unapologetic.
  * Red background, white text → hover flips to black.

* **Cards:**

  * Color‑blocked with bold red/black headers.
  * Use oversized names & roles.
  * White body space for details.
* **Dividers:**

## 7. Motion & Feel

* **Transitions:** Snappy, high‑energy.
* **Hover Effects:** Shake, zoom, color flip.
* **Page Flow:** Scroll reveals with dramatic text entrances (e.g., slide in, rotate in).
